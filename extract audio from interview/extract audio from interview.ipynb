Αυτό είναι μόνο ένα πρόγραμμα βίντεο που θα κάνουμε όλοι. Πρέπει να είναι λιγότερο από ένα λεπτό και να περάσω μερικές ερωτήσεις που σας έδωσα μέσω e-mail. Θα σας δώσω ένα παράδειγμα, θα περάσω τις ερωτήσεις μόνος μου. Το όνομά μου είναι Θεός Ευγενίου, τα κυριαρχικά δίκαια μου είναι τεχνογραφία και τεχνογραφία, και είμαι στο ΙΣΙΑΔ από το 2001. Δεύτερη ερώτηση. Ποια είναι οι δύο σημαντικές ρόλες, εργασίες, εργασίες που θέλω να δουλέψω στο επόμενο ή αν έχω ήδη εργασία, ποιο ρόλο θα συμμετέχω στο επόμενο. Σε αυτό το περίπτωσέ μου θα παραμείνω προφητείς στο ΙΣΙΑΔ στο επόμενο. Ποια είναι οι δύο σημαντικές ρόλες που θέλετε να αποκάλυψετε από το δρόμο σας. Ως εγώ, η κυριαρχική σημασία θα είναι η αν συλλογικά, με την συναλλαγή, θα έχουμε μια καλύτερη, πιο πρακτική, πιο προσεκτική και πιο σωστή οπτική του GEN-AI και το τι σημαίνει για το επιχειρήμα και την κοινωνία. Και η μεγάλη επιτυχία θα είναι αν κάποιοι από εσάς καταλήξουν να δουλέψουν κάποιες από τις προϊόντες και επιχειρήματα και επιχειρήματα που θα δουλέψετε κατά τη διάρκεια αυτού του δρόμου. Ελπίζοντας ακόμα και με βοήθεια από κάποιους από τους συνεργάτες που συνεργάζονται στο δρόμο, αλλά επίσης και από άλλους. Είχατε κάποια εμπειρία με το πυθόν ή άλλα πράγματα, είναι η ερώτηση 4. Έχω δουλέψει για αρκετά χρόνια στη ζωή μου, ακόμα και δεν είμαι ένας πολύ καλός πυθόν κωδικός. Στην πραγματικότητα, είμαι πολύ κακός. Νούμερο 5, ένα ενδιαφέρουσιο αρτίκλο, ιδέα ή κόνσετ που έκανες σχετικά με την AI. Παρακαλώ, στην περίπτωσή μου, παρακαλώ, έχω παρακολουθήσει αρκετά από αυτούς τους στους συλλαβούς.

      "Hello everybody and welcome to the new MBA elective, Building Gen AI Products and Businesses. I'm Theos Evgeniou and I'm looking forward to seeing you next week in this course. This is just an intro video recording that all of us will do. It's supposed to be less than one minute and go through a few questions I sent you by email. Let me give you an example, I'm going to go through the questions myself. First question is name, main degree, key role before INSEAD. My name is Theos Evgeniou, my main degree is in engineering and computer science and I've been at INSEAD since 2001. Second question, what are the two potential roles, jobs, industries I wish to work on next or if I already have a job, what role do I join next? In my case, I will remain a professor at INSEAD next. What are the top two outcomes you wish to get out of the course? Well, hopefully you have more than two. From my side, the main objective success will look like if we collectively by exchanging with each other, we all gain a better, more practical, more up to date and more sober view of Gen AI and what it means for business and society. And the big success will be if some of you end up building some of the products and businesses that you will work on during this course. Hopefully even with funding from some of the partner VCs that are joining the course, but also others. Do you have any experience coding with Python or others? Question number four. I've been coding for quite some time in my life, although I'm not a really good Python coder. Actually, I'm pretty bad at that. Number five, an interesting article or idea or concept you read about recently regarding Gen AI, please share. In my case, I shared quite a few of them in the syllabus. Thank you again and looking forward to seeing you next week in class.\n",
